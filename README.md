# ðŸ“š Bookshop â€” Full-stack Online Bookstore
The Book Shop Project is a cross-platform system with a macOS app for employees, an iOS app for customers, and a .NET RESTful API. Staff manage inventory and orders via the macOS app, while customers browse and shop through the iOS app. Both apps connect to a secure .NET backend for data sync, auth, and business logic.
